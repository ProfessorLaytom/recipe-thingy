    <img src="../img/macaroons.jpg" alt="some nice macaroons">
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) package sweetened flaked coconut </li>
        <li>⅔ cup sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 large egg whites, at room temperature</li>
        <li>8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The cooking</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Preheat an air fryer to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C) for 10 minutes. Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit the air fryer basket, leaving 1 inch on each side to use as handles.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Mix coconut, condensed milk, salt, and vanilla together in a large bowl.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Beat egg whites in a medium bowl with an electric mixer with a whisk attachment on medium-high speed until stiff peaks almost form, about 90 seconds. Fold egg whites into the coconut mixture.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Working in batches, spoon level tablespoons of the coconut mixture into rounds and place on the parchment paper, about 6 at time. Carefully transfer the parchment with coconut rounds into the air fryer basket.</p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Cook until golden brown and set, 9 to 10 minutes. Remove parchment from basket, transfer macaroons to a wire rack, and repeat the process with remaining coconut mixture using the same piece of parchment paper.</p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Microwave chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl on high power for 30 seconds, then stir. Continue microwaving and stirring in 30 second increments, until melted and smooth, about 90 seconds total.</p>
    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>Dip flat bottoms of macaroons into melted chocolate and transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet to set. Let rest until chocolate firms, about 30 minutes.</p>
